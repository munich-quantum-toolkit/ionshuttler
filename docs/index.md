# MQT IonShuttler

MQT IonShuttler provides a framework to utilize quantum computing as a technology for users with little to no quantum computing knowledge
It is developed as part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_.

We recommend you to start with the {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`.
Then proceed with the sections below.
If you are interested in the theory behind MQT IonShuttler, have a look at the publications in the {doc}`publication list <references>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project.
If you want to contribute, you can find more information in the {doc}`contribution guide <contributing>`.
If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of MQT QuSAT, please let us know on our {doc}`support page <support>`.

## Usage

### Exact Solution (single PZ)

```console
(.venv) $ python scripts/run_exact.py --help
(.venv) $ python scripts/run_heuristic.py inputs/algorithms_exact/qft_06.json
```

The script supports an additional `--plot` argument to visualise the result.
Architectures and algorithms are specified in JSON files.
For examples, see [`inputs/algorithms_exact`](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ionshuttler/blob/main/inputs/algorithms_exact/).

### Heuristic Solution (single & multiple PZs)

```console
(.venv) $ python scripts/run_heuristic.py --help
(.venv) $ python scripts/run_heuristic.py inputs/algorithms_heuristic/qft_60_4pzs.json
```

Architectures and algorithms are specified in JSON files.
For examples, see [`inputs/algorithms_heuristic`](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ionshuttler/blob/main/inputs/algorithms_heuristic/).
